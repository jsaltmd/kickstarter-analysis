# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in order to help assess if Louise's play "FEVER" with a targetted budget of $10,000 can be successfully funded. A data analysis was performed on several thousand crowfunding projects to determine if it is feasible.  

The first analysis was to look into the different categories to determine which crowfunding was successful. Overall, the result shows (see charts 1 and 2 below) that the "Theater" category has performed well amongts the rest with 839 out of 1393 plays were successful.

Looking at outcomes based on launch date focusing only on plays, the campaign has >100% success rate when launching it in the month of May and June and it tapers down at the end of the year. November and December are not good for starting campaigns as it is the busiest months of the year due to the holidays.

Based on statistical analysis of plays conducted in the US (see attached excel workbook, tab titled "Descriptive Statistics"), the median goal for successful plays are around $5,000. Most projects failed because the goals were very high (median goal of $10,000) or people are not willing to pledge. Therefore, a maximum campaign goal of $5,000, starting May or June would be very ideal for Louise to start her crowfunding project.

A data analysis was also performed in the Great Britain's theater market. Based on the assessment, the goals are mostly less than 4,000 pounds which is within Louise's budget. Therefore, a campaign goal of less than 2,000 pounds to produces the play would be ideal. See attached excel workbook, tab titled 'the Edinburgh research" for more details.
