# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in order to help assess if Louise's play "FEVER" with a targetted budget of $10,000 can be successfully funded. A data analysis was performed on several thousand crowfunding projects to determine if it is feasible.  

The first analysis was to look into the different categories to determine which crowfunding was successful. The result shows (see charts 1 and 2 below) that "Theater" category has performed well with 839 out of 1393 plays were successful.

Looking at outcomes based on launch date focusing only on plays, the campaign has >100% success rate when launching it in the month of May and June and it tapers down throughout the year. November and December are not good for starting a campaign because these are the busiest months of the year due to holidays.
