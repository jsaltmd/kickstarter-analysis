# Kickstarter Analysis Module-1 Challenge
Performing analysis to complete the module 1 challenge 

## *Overview of Project*

#### The client's (Louise) play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Based on the Kickstarter dataset, Fever was only 86% funded with a goal of $2,885 and an outcome of $2,485 and it ran for only a month, from June to July. 

#### The client has requested to conduct a data analysis to assess how other campaigns' fund raising goals fared with hers in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.  

## *Analysis and Challenges*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- First, the data was analyzed to look at the outcome based on launch date. As shown on chart 1, the trend shows that the peak for successful campaigns is in the month of May. However, Louise's campaign was launched in June where the trend started to decline. However, June is still a good month to start a campaign. Most campaigns over the years that started in Q1 or Q4 have higher failures and therefore, her decision to held it in Q2 was fine. 

- It could be hypothesized that a shorter campaign (one month) has probably impacted Louise's success to achieve her goal given that she only needed $400 to fund it.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- The data shows that most campaigns with higher goals were not successful. There were a lot of pledges on other campaigns that have asked for less than $5,000 and even more successful for less than $1,000 as shown on chart 2. Louise's campaign goal was within this range and was only short of $400 but she could probably have benefited if she ran her campaign a little bit longer and less than $1,000 for a shorter campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Some additional data could have helped with the assessment, such as campaign strategy, duration of the campaigns, etc... to help understand why she did not make it and came very close to her goal. I have generated some additional data (e.g. date range) and modified the required charts to make it easier to perform the data analysis.   

## *Results*

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. *Based on the assessment, Louise's chance to achieve her goal could have increased if she started her campaign a month earlier (month of May) or ran it for a little bit longer.*

2. *Campaigns when launched around Q1 and Q4 of the year have more chances of failure probably because these are the busiest months due to a lot of holidays. Refer to chart 3 below.*

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. *The data shows that most successful campaigns that have funding goals that are less than $5,000 are successful, even more so when it is less than equal to $1,000. Chart 4 shows that more people tend to support campaigns that have lower funding.*

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

1. *It doesnt have additional information as to why low budgetted campaigns are mostly favored than high budgetted campaigns.*

2. *It doesnt have the information regarding campaign strategy that would explain why Louise play came close rather than a total failure.*

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1. *Bar graphs, pie chart, etc...*
